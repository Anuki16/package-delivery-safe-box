# Package Delivery Safe Box

Getting packages delivered to the home is a frequent practice in modern life, and its popularity is increasing with services such as online shopping. A common issue faced by customers using delivery services is receiving a package when no one is at home to accept it. In this scenario the delivery person might leave the package outside, which might lead to it getting stolen or damaged.

This product is a password-locked box to safekeep packages delivered to a house when no one is at home. The box should be fixed outside the house similar to a letter box. A one-time password can be set and communicated to the delivery person to open
the box and leave the package.
